Description
--
The coasts have washed away, worn by the tides of time. One spit of land remains, overgrown with fungi. Only three lifeforms cling to existence: Mushroom-infected cows, a strange species of delicious flightless birds, and you.

Welcome to Myconesia, a Mushroom Island Challenge modpack.

Myconesia
/mīˈkōˈniːʒə/
*noun*
1. An island covered in fungi.
2. The only landmass remaining after the Mycopalypse.
Etymology: From Greek *myco-* "fungus" + *-nesia* "island".

This modpack features:
* Gameplay focused on Botania, The Twilight Forest, and the Mushroom Challenge from vanilla
* Fishing as a method of early game resource gathering
* Unique methods for farming wood
* Vanilla saplings as an endgame goal
* A mostly peaceful overworld with no ores besides coal
* A superhostile nether full of ores
* Custom structures in the Nether and End
* Documentation provided in the form of JEI info tabs

You might like this modpack if:
* You tend to overlook Botania or Twilight Forest, and want a pack that puts them in the spotlight
* You get overwhelmed by all the options available in bigger modpacks and prefer more focused gameplay
* You've always wanted to build a mushroom island base, or an underwater base
* You wish you had more opportunity to use dim lighting for ambience
* You want peaceful gameplay interspersed with intense combat
* You're sick of starting the game by punching wood
* You want a reason to farm huge mushrooms
* You like Botania but dislike how its petals and flowers clutter up your inventory
* You think Shimmering Mushrooms are pretty

You might **not** like this modpack if:
* You prefer big packs with lots of mods and/or quests
* You expect access to vanilla saplings in the early game
* You enjoy turbo-charged endgame goals like Draconic Evolution, Avaritia, and Creative items

Many common mods aren't in this pack. For example:

* There's no Journeymap because I prefer Antique Atlas
* There's no Pam's HarvestCraft because I prefer Hatchling Snacks (though I might be biased)
* There's no Iron Chests or Storage Drawers or Refined Storage or Applied Energistics because I think vanilla chests + Charset barrels + Quark pipes are better suited to a pack that doesn't have many very many extra items
* No backpack/pouch/bag mods because, again, there aren't that many items so Hand of Ender + Bauble Shulker Boxes is enough
* Similarly, no WAILA because F3 is enough when the modlist is this small
* No Tinker's, Reliquary, Cyclic, Random Things, or Extra Utilities because they would eclipse some tools from Botania
* No Gravestone mod because Quark's Totem of Holding has that feature covered

If you feel your experience would be enhanced by any of the mods I omitted, I encourage you to install them.
